# derp

A skill issue simulator for AI coding agents.

Generates confidently broken code, sarcastic commentary about your prompting abilities, and an infinite fix cycle that never converges on working code.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add bigboggy/derp
```

## What it does

- Produces code that looks plausible but is fundamentally wrong
- Leaves sarcastic inline comments diagnosing your skill issue
- Every "fix" introduces a new bug while claiming to solve the previous one
- Gradually escalates into referencing fictional libraries, made-up design patterns, and non-existent Stack Overflow posts
- Never breaks character
